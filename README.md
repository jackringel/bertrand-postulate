# bertrand-postulate
Graph the relationship between a number and the number of primes between itself and its double

Testing bertrand's postulate (this number should always be >=1)

might add stuff later to analyze the curve, idk
from basic testing looks mostly linear, number of primes between a number and its double is around 1/10 of the original number
